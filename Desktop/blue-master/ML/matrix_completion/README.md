# Matrix Completion Tests

All Matrix Completion experiments can be found in the two jupyter notebooks
"Matrix Completion.ipynb" and "Matrix Completion Experimentation.ipynb".

These can be examined directly to execute the experiments if jupyter is
installed. Alternatively, the corresponding html files can be examined to
simply see the results of the experiment.
